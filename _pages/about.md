I am Abdon Troche. I have a background in electronic engineering with enphasis in mechatronics, and I am currently working as a CTO in a Paraguayan Startup that manufacture bicycles and e-bikes. The Startup name is [ROD Bicycles](https://www.rodbicycles.com/).

While attending university I worked doing prosthetics hands and arms in [Po Paraguay](https://www.facebook.com/poparaguay/). 

For long time I volunteer in an American space called [Benjamin Franklin Science Corner](https://www.facebook.com/BenjaminFranklinScienceCorner/). 

I also did internship in the [Fab Lab CIDi](https://www.fablabs.io/labs/fablabcidi/). After that they gave me a scholarship for the Fab Academy in Lima-Peru in 2019. Here you can find my [Fab Academy website](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/tecsup/students/abdon-rotela/). Three years later I become a Fab Academy Instructor in the first Fab Academy made in Paraguay, here you can take a look, [Fab Academy 2022 at the Fab Lab CIDi](https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/cidi/). 

All of this gave me an immeasurable knowledge about digital fabrication and machine building skills.
